1. Extract helper classes into separate files.
2. namespace keyword is usually placed under the using statements
3. Since DataReader class is not only responsible for reading data maybe a more suitable name, like DataProcessor would be more appropriate.

5. In ImportedObject the Name property is already derived prom parent class
6. In ImportedObject some properties didnt have get; set; keywords
7. In DataReader the namespace clause should be declared under the using statements.

10. The initialization of fields and properties is better expressed when it's hidden in a constructor.
