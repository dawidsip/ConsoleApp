1. Extract helper classes into separate files.
2. namespace keyword is usually placed under the using statements.
3. Since DataReader class is not only responsible for reading data perhaps a more suitable name, like DataProcessor would be more appropriate.
4. ImportedObjectBaseClass is not quite a clean name for a base class, we can ditch the Class part an only leave ImportedObjectBase.
5. In ImportedObject the Name property is already derived from the parent class.
6. In ImportedObject some properties didn't have get; set; keywords
7. In DataReader the namespace clause should be declared under the using statements.
8. ImportedObjects seams like its a class field, and a private at that, and not a Property. Thus instead of CamelCase we should switch to pascalCase.
9. now importedObjects does not need to be initialized with a one object. It can be left empty on initialization.
10. The initialization of fields and properties is better expressed when it's hidden in a constructor.
11. The ImportAndPrint method is not SOLID - compliant, it does whey to many things. Lets split it's logic into simpler methods.
12. Console.ReadLine() does not do anything besides await a user response. Maybe this was left accidently and was once used as a debugging aid. We can safely throw it away.
13. Since we already import the Linq library, lets make use of it and swap the for loops for some Linq-methods.
14. Assigning number of children is very nested, this usually means there is room for improvement/simplification, so lets give it a try.
15. PrintData is another deeply nested structure that should be further simplified
